This is the simple website for the python class taught by nk15@rice.edu and jl51@rice.edu for the Korean international
students for Spring 2017. Built on top of Django for easy use. Nothing fancy.

TODO:
- make a template for the jupyter generated lecture htmls.
- add previous years lectures to it.
- add more features
- add a model so that the lectures are tracked in some form.
- host this on an EC2 instance using zappa + AWS lambda.
- add some more tests.

FIXME:
- the lecture slides must be scrollable
- the UI issues. See Lectures a herf doesn't work.
- most text are editable even if contenteditable set to false.
- get the test class to work.
